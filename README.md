# Mongodb-Scraper-HMWK18

#### In this assignment, we create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news stories. But we will not actually write any articles; instead, we will use Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from another site.

#### The following technology will be used for this homework.
Run npm init. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:
- axios
- body-parser
- cheerio
- express
- express-handlebars
- mongoose
- morgan
- npm
- request


#### To launch this app in a browser use the following https.
